# C-SHARP
it's about the practice stuffs with c#

1.program.cs::::->
program.cs is clearly showing the use of stringbuilder in csharp.

2.string_manipulation::::->
workiing with some string methods like "join" and "concat".

3.prim_number::::->
about 3 functions one is actually for checking prime number from the user and other two for printing some patterns.

4.odd_even+largest+natural_numbers::::->
made 3 functions 
  first one is to find wheather the number is odd or even second one is to find largest of 3 and the last one for printing natural numbers upto a user input.
  
5.primenumber_within_range::::->
print out all the prime numbers in a range from the user.

6.split_and_join_with_list::::->
by using split method spliting a string with '.' and converting it into a list of items,then again the list is converted to a string without '.' by join method in c#

7.fibonacci::::->
printing fibonacci series upto a usr input.

8.factorial_armstrong::::->
finding factorial of a user input and second one is to check wheather the user gave a an armstrong number or not.

9.Rearranging_integer_array_max_min_order::::->
two functions both are used to arrange an integer array as
    {1,9,4,2,6,7}==>{9,1,7,2,6,4} as maximum and minimum sequence order.
    first one uses two sorted arrays are on is ascending order and another on is descending order and picking index values alternatively.
    second one use a single sorted array(ascending order) and set two index pointers of min and max and alternatively picking each to another array.
    
 10.working_with_string::::->
 as the name indicates some operations on strings..
    1.individual()---->seperates the string into individual characters.
    2.wordscount()---->gives the total number of words seperated by space " ".
    3.integerremoval()---->removes all the integers from a input string.
    4.concati()---->without a library function concatinating two strings from user.
    
11.bubble_sort::::->
sorting an array using bubble sort.

12.insertion_sort::::->
sorting of numbers in an array with insertion sort logic.

13.StringOperations
playing with some strings interesting operations.

14.pyramid pattern
printing a pyramid pattern by entering the rows.

15.matrixAddition
performing matrix addition in c sharp.

16.matrix_Multiplication
performing matrix multiplication in c sharp
